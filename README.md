## Title Links (ERPNext version 12 support)

### Note
I added allowed routes functions so that this Link field formatter only works on desired routes and not breaking other Link fields on some routes. Because somehow this formatter doesn't worked on reference_doctype field at 'Data Export'. You can add your preffered routes at Title Link Fields Formatter Setup doctype.

##

In some cases, we need hide the standard name of a DocType in favor of another value in the doctype, 
and get it simple to the end user.

Title Links, do exactly it, it replace the value displayed in the **Links** and **Dynamic Links** fields, 
to the value of the title field, defined in your **DocTypes**.

When the title is not present, we will ensure the same behavior of the original widgets of frappe, displaying 
the name.

That is how the normal behavior of Link Widget looks like:

This is how the related record looks like in frappe

Frappe, already replace the title value in the visualization area of the Form, and show the original name, in the right side of the form, as a small text.
Why we can't do the same to the links?

To me it's by designe is not enought, so I decided to hack frappe.

After install this app, and configure the DocTypes that you need to change to title, like the below image,

Your links will look like

A selected value will look like

Don't worry with Link Formatters, title links already define it to you!
